# Resume Work

1.  **Run Context Summary Script**
    Run the helper script to see the current git status and active tasks.
    
    ```bash
    chmod +x scripts/context_summary.sh
    ./scripts/context_summary.sh
    ```

2.  **Review Action Items**
    Read the full action items list to see what is next.
    
    ```bash
    cat docs/action_items.md
    ```

3.  **Check Latest Artifacts**
    (Optional) Check the project brief for high-level goals.
    
    ```bash
    cat docs/project_brief.md
    ```
